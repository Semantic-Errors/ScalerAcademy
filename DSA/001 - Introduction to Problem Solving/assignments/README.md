You have to follow the following steps to find the sqrt of an integer N.

Consider L = 1, R = N, and cnt = 0

STEP 1: MID = (floor)(L+R)/2 and cnt += 1

STEP 2: if ((MID * MID) == N), then go to STEP 5 else go to STEP 3.

STEP 3: if ((MID * MID) < N), then L = MID+1 and go to STEP 1 else STEP 4.  

STEP 4: if ((MID * MID) > N), then R = MID - 1 and go to STEP 1.

STEP 5: PRINT MID.

 

If the value of N is 36, what will be the value of cnt?
